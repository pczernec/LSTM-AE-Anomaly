# LSTM AutoEncoder Anomaly detection

Repository contains code used in paper "Anomaly detection in industrial data stream"
The goal was to evaluate following methods:
- LSTMAE + MLP
- LSTMAE + SVM
- LSTMAE + OCSVM

For this purpose we used "New Gas Pipeline" dataset proposed in [1]. Methods we have used were inspired by [2]
